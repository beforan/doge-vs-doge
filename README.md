# Doge vs Doge
A shiba inu inspired take on Spy vs Spy, submitted for [Mini Ludum Dare #49](http://ludumdare.com)

## What to do?

So you'd like to do something with Doge vs Doge?
- You can get a binary release for Windows (x86, or x64) from the Releases page
- You can get the source and run it - be sure check the dependencies section below!
- You can use any of the source as licensed - check out the licensing section below!

The only thing you can't do is contribute to this project itself. See the contributions section below for details.

## Status

Doge vs Doge is semi-complete. I have a short roadmap of bugfixes and improvements, but that's it. And I can't say when they'll be done.

Binary Releases are available for Windows (x86 and x64) simply because I use Windows on a day-to-day basis.

The source can be used to run Doge vs Doge on any platform supported by the [L&Ouml;VE Framework](http://love2d.org)

## Dependencies

The source provided here depends upon the [L&Ouml;VE Framework](http://love2d.org), so you'll need to get that for your platform of choice.

It also requires an assets package, available under Releases. All assets are provided and used under license; license details are contained in the package.

If you use a binary release, neither the assets nor L&Ouml;VE are required.
